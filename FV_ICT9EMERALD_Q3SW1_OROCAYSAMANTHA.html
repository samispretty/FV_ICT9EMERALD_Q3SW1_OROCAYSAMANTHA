</div>
<br>
<p><b>Alice in Borderland (今際の国のアリス Imawa no Kuni no Alice?) is a Japanese sci-fi thriller live-action series directed by Shinsuke Sato based on the manga series of the same name, originally written and illustrated by Haro Aso. It was written by Sato, Yoshiki Watabe, and Yasuko Kuramitsu. The first season premiered on Netflix on December 10, 2020. On December 24, 2020, it was announced that the series was renewed for a second season, barely two weeks after its online debut. The announcement came from numerous social accounts for Netflix around the world. 

Arisu—a listless, jobless, and video-game-obsessed young man—suddenly finds himself in a strange, emptied-out version of Tokyo in which he and his friends must compete in dangerous games in order to survive. In this strange world where his friends are now dead and he is left suicidal, Arisu meets Usagi, a young woman who’s navigating the games alone. Together, they set out to unravel one mystery after another as they risk their lives and confront what it means to live.</b></p>
